       " 'a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal event i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian movie the production values hey its an independent movie with a shoe string budget so ya its going to look a bit cheesy if your standard is a list hollywood fare but properly compared with other independent movies this film is perfectly acceptable more important than acting style costumes and music is the narrative itself is the story compelling do the dramatic moments work does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax the answer to all these questions is an unqualified yes as a side note the truly important technical stuff  continuity sound lighting  are fine the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship content value the message of the movie is superb when you consider how many ideas the movie maker developed within the brief span of    minutes you begin to appreciate his artistry he presents the message of salvation the consequence of unbelief the danger of backsliding the truth of the rapture and the threat of a world dominating satanic government with flare imagination and  most importantly for an evangelical movie  with biblical accuracy the movie maker is a good storyteller for example he develops the message of salvation in two important ways   he shows us through action the reality of jesus christs sacrifice for our sake this is achieved in a subplot where the zoo keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies the only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake poison the poison is like sin the cure is like christs blood shed on the cross   the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in christ so the movie maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story as a side note the fact that a movie produced by evangelical christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation couched in explicitly evangelical christian language imagery and theology is also perfectly acceptable to criticize this film for being explicitly christian is absurd its akin to criticizing a nike commercial for promoting sport wear what else would evangelical christian movie makers make if not a film that states their case also the fact that the movie maker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is again perfectly acceptable the movie maker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably how do i know i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in      it still lived in her memory thirty years later how many movies can you say that about all around a very enjoyable thought provoking show i plan on showing it to my teen group at church',\n",

       " 'in      director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster and that he did   with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast the result was  scarface starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles the story begins in may of      when castro opened the harbor at mariel cuba to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states        left cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in america and most were honest hard working people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted but not all among the  marielitos who streamed into florida approximately       had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cubas jails   criminals considered beyond redemption who castro had merely wanted to be rid of and they too saw america as a land of opportunity even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as  caracortada scarface now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all wealth and power   that was montanas dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert loggia lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castros goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in  little havana along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives and in short order montana sees to it that lopezs brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of america lopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets montana and his friend manny steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work in his day capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but lopez has the modern day equivalent and its even more lucrative cocaine lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it montana isnt satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be at the  top with a cold blooded iron will montana decides hell do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost but before its over he will realize the price for his dream and hell pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what its like to be the man and he will also know whether or not it was worth it in step with de palmas vision pacino plays montana larger than life and he does it beautifully from the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right   and he did to the body language and the attitude hes got it all and it makes montana convincing and very real what he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors de niro would be one can this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacinos screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though its hard to become emotionally involved with him its quite simply a dynamic memorable performance michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom as elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of montanas dream pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance she like pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanor the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio gina miriam colon mama montana f murray abraham omar paul shenar sosa and harris yulin bernstein an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed  traffic and  blow and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpahs  the wild bunch de palmas  scarface originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing but if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end and like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time but the reward is always worth it and thats the way it is

       " 'great movie enough laughs and action for any audience since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call woody allen incestuous and not comment on the film here i am the film follows an unlikely duo johansson and allen as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased english reporter their search takes them into the home of the killer and eventually to a somewhat tragic end but dont let the plot fool you the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superb it seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right clint eastwood allen and pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers also from watching the movie in a pact theater you can just tell that people really love woody allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback the second he walked on screen audience lit up theres just something about the man and he really shines in scoop  check it out its worth the trip',\n",
       " 'first of all let me comment that the audience loved it from the first moment perhaps current events in the middle east led people to take the attitude i came for a comedy and by george im going to enjoy it but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it the last few times woody has tried to do a straight comedy small time crooks curse of the jade scorpion hollywood ending ive felt like the one liners felt strained and a bit antiquated i remember thinking at one point that would have been funny in the early sixties so going in to this movie i was afraid woody was becoming tone deaf however in this one his comic sensibilities were in perfect tune admittedly there were plenty of my fellow aarp card carrying folks in the screening but there were also plenty of    somethings and    somethings as well and they all seemed to get it and give up the occasional belly laugh in addition to numerous guffaws chuckles and the like in many instances the throw aways had people laughing so loud you missed the next line thematically woody was traipsing familiar ground as i suspected from the trailer this film had a lot of manhattan murder mystery in it but then again there was more than a smidgen of oedipus wrecks new york stories alice and even a little tribute to broadway danny rose at the very beginning even with woody in the movie scarlett as sondra was at times the woody proxy but her character was far from the nebbish that say will ferrell gave us in melinda and melinda or kenneth branaugh attempted in celebrity instead of archetypal ticks and quirks sondras nerdishness comes directly from the family history which she shares early on on numerous occasions the family business leads her to malapropisms that we get as an audience while the characters on the screen can only perceive them as strange non sequiturs since we are all in on the joke we cant help but laugh but the laughs dont come from recognizing the woody nebbish but truly from the character to a great extent unlike farrell branaugh cusack or even mia farrow before her scarlett is not required to use the woody voice to evoke the woody role thus we dont find ourselves ripped out of the narrative as a woodys voice suddenly emerges from someone else face as my friend commented on the way out sid the character played by woody is a supporting role but more center stage than i was hoping going in however this time woody seems to have written a character that truly fits his current persona unlike his ed dobel sage character in anything else or his blind director in hollywood ending this time the character is a comfortable fit perhaps more importantly this time the character works in the story within the elevated circles they find themselves in he is even more fish out of water than scarlett which is used to great comedic effect throughout sid is a declining itinerant magician playing to small audiences but the fact that he is from another era is placed front and center for our enjoyment but what about jackman what about ian swearengen mcshane i liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece i particularly liked mcshanes short but effective turns jackman is charming with the ease of old money that was so often portrayed in films from    years ago class echoes from purple rose of cairo so what did i think short answer maybe his best straight comedy since     s bullets over broadway less stylized than mighty aphrodite less caustic than deconstructing harry less forced than small time crooks or hollywood ending woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the   st century',\n",

       " 'despite loving rita hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler symbolic aspects of the cinematography the lady from shanghai didnt quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film thats mostly people talking with each other in various situations thats quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a   for me the lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles character michael ohara ohara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him ohara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk ohara into working for them despite his initial reservations  it seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and ohara doesnt want to get involved shortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says hes arthurs partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks ohara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly ohara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far im not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i havent seen anywhere near the majority of welles work yet but ive tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performance arty i love f for fake vrits et mensonges      for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale      when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane      never did much for me despite giving it   or   chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low    the same as my current score for the lady from shanghai welles performance and the dialogue hes written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me hes a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotone  he tends to sound like hes reading his performance reminded me of what ive seen of welles version of moby dick listed on imdb as      but completed in      it can also be seen in orson welles the one man band      where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that hes inherently sublimely dramatic im also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too as for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course shes gorgeous which doesnt hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me  i never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesnt seem to fit welles often shoots him in close up and anders almost always has some over exaggerated manic expression on his sweaty face structurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first    minutes or so are extremely bland and soap operatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crime mystery film its too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence the ending is more action oriented less dialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime mystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a   the final scenes are easily   s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time its well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually cant make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the maze like caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romance surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course its worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isnt exactly a terrible film in my view but its dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution',\n",

       " 'i have always been a great admirer of nicolas roeg and walkabout is one of my favorite films this is a film version of roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of roegs cinematic flare very unique story is about a famous actress theresa russell who after a hard nights work on a film in      goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael emil and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door her husband is a famous ex baseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesnt testify at a hearing theresa russell is just excellent and while shes not trying exactly to impersonate marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobias and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage you can make an excellent case that this is russells best performance and i probably wouldnt argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will sampson of cuckoos nest and they discuss what cherokee indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we russell and roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film',\n",

famous fun house finale the lady from shanghai has gained a position of importance beyond its actual worth as a key to the saga of orson welles failure to conquer hollywood by      welles position as a hollywood figure was mixed citizen kane was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the hearst press and by hollywood insiders themselves welles attempt at total control direction and production and acting of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system his best job in this period was as edward rochester in jane eyre supposedly shot by robert stevenson but actually shot in large measure with stevensons blessing by welles but the credit went to stevenson only the stranger a film benefiting from a postwar interest in fleeing nazi war criminals made a profit for five years in hollywood it was barely a great record welles returned to broadway in      hoping to recapture his critical abilities by his production of around the world in    days but despite the assistance mike todd and cole porter composing the score the musical was a failure his failure occurred just at the same time that his wife rita hayworth was on the rise with her portrayal of gilda so the marriage was going on the rocks as well welles had to make money   his broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy he sold his interest in the possible movie rights to around the world to todd which he would eventually rue and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of henri desire landru to charlie chaplin who was supposed to be directed in it and who turned it into monsieur verdoux the story goes that welles with a          tax bill to worry about called cohn and offered to do a film with rita for a down payment cohn was willing to do so but naturally asked what the film was it was a wise question welles was on a pay phone in new york in a pharmacy that had a book department he grabbed a book with the title the lady from shanghai and raved that it was a great thriller somehow welles convinced the normally astute cohn that welles knew what he was talking about cohn said hed look into getting the rights and sent welles his down payment of          after cohn hung up welles bought the book and read it   and found it was really pretty bad he spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up ritas character of elsa bannister certainly it has a curious plot development michael ohara is a seaman longshoreman he rescues elsa bannister when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in san francisco elsa is married to arthur bannister everett sloane a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation she convinces him to hire michael as the skipper of their yacht the cruise also contains bannisters sinister partner george grisby glenn anders and one sidney broome ted de corsia who turns out to be a detective hired by bannister to watch elsa when they can michael and elsa try to find time together but broome or grisby keeps showing up grisby makes michael an offer   he wants for reasons connected to his so called fatalistic view of modern society to drop out of it pretending to be dead according to grisby the plot becomes murky here he can still collect his life insurance although dead and use it to run off to the south seas he will pay michael          if he will pretend to shoot grisby this includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that grisby is probably dead of course grisby is killed and michael is arrested for that and for the murder of broome shot with michaels gun michael is tried with bannister defending him and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants michael to be convicted michael is convinced that bannister is the actual murderer and manages to escape just before the jury verdict he is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival and this leads to the famous fun house sequence and the conclusion of the film its a terribly confusing movie as i have had commented on that does not mean its not worth seeing   visually it is striking witness the fight between michael and the police in the trial judges quarters where he knocks the bailiff into the judges bookcase shattering glass or the clever use of photography to capture hayworth diving from a rock reflected on the lecherous grisbys binoculars the acting is pretty good in particular sloane possibly that fine actors best film role glenn anders was a leading broadway performer he rarely made movies before the lady from shanghai and his slimy grisby is unforgettable also ted de corsia does very nicely with broome   a detective who is really looking for his own interests to his own cost as for hayworth she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before blood and sand tales of manhattan and the strawberry blond are exceptions and is a memorable siren welles ohara is a very unusual character for the actor   a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe its not kane ambersoms othello touch of evil or chimes at midnight but it is a good film for all that',\n",

       " 'a masterpiece of comedy a masterpiece of horror a masterpiece of romance if there is anything negative to say about a chinese ghost story it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology the film has a simple premise a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt of course it happens to be haunted as well what i wasnt expecting the first time i saw this film is that its one of the most touching love stories ive ever seen that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches unlike some films of asian cinema a chinese ghost story isnt hard to swallow for those that arent versed in chinese culture indeed it plays on timeless cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance think evil dead   if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix this film is for real despite being overlooked by many its absolutely among the best ive ever seen its ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere is nothing short of fantastic highly recommended      ',\n",
       " 'i just viewed this great good natured parody of night of the living dead and i have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent this movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery the supposable abandoned house the basement and the front lawn what i especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against cmon we know that toasters toaster ovens and zip locks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread aside from the cheap acting and voice overs this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of night of the living dead even better than night of the living dead of      i think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous another great reason why i love this movie is that there is no exception as to what bread is evil bagels are evil and even communions are evil which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest i think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread ie the car scene i think the end is very worth sticking around even though this is a short and that night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating hellbound zombified living dead part   in shocking   d is debatably another great parody its still recommend as a great horror parody done by what seems to be college filmmakers i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of night of the living dead and still have respect for the filmmakers i would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves d movies and horror parodys its just a wonderful little short horror film thats fun to watch and learn',\n",

       " 'by      hong kong had given the world such films as sammo hungs  encounters of the spooky kind chow yun fat in john woos iconic  a better tomorrow  zu warriors and the classic  mr vampire jackie chan was having international success on video but it was with  a chinese ghost story that hk cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the west for many years western filmgoers had never seen anything like it it was a film that took various ingredients that hk cinema had used for years flying swordsman wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look feel and execution forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned this is the original and best director siu tung ching still best known as an action choreographer on such films as woos  a better tomorrow   the killer has under the watchful eye of legendary producer tsui hark created a masterpiece of fantasy horror cinema and with such an expert crew at his disposal no less than   martial arts coordinators the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable the editing by the amazingly prolific david wu who wrote directed  the bride with white hair   and edited such classic titles as  a better tomorrow        hardboiled and the cult hit  the club is quite simply a work of genius his crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best hk cinema has ever created fast moving outlandish but never confusing they are even today the pinnacle of their art the crew of cinematographers have also done miracles this is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting where wonderful blue tinged night sequences shrouded in an ever present ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold its a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty even the silken robes and dresses worn by hsiao tsing become living parts of the movie whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen even a simple scene where hsiao tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act the sets are also amazing giving an other worldly sense to the forests and the temple and harshness to the scorched flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale the production design by zhongwen xi deserves the highest praise another major factor to the films success is the music by romeo diaz and james wong hong kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence but on  a chinese ghost story the music is quite simply vital from the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters the score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments drums bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect but its in the slower achingly romantic pieces that it comes into its own here flutes strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an hk film add to this the female vocal stunningly beautiful song that plays over tsau shens and hsiao tsings love making nothing is ever seen but the effect is wonderful this is lovingly innocent movie romance and you have a shining example of the power a films music can have and we of course have the acting talent leslie cheung  a better tomorrow       and a very popular singer is outstanding as the innocent tax collector his work in the thankfully mild comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with joey wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence joey wang who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the chow yun fat andy lau classic god of gamblers has never looked more radiant than how she does here she is the epitome of ethereal beauty her portrayal of the tragic hsiao tsing is stunning she shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths veteran actor wu ma  mr vampire  swordsman is great fun as the wise brave but ever so grumpy yen he treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease and what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable but what about the monsters and beasties i hear you cry well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting tsau shen to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective lord black complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads and quite outstanding wire work most of which has to this day never been topped but the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirits killer tongue we first encounter this thing with an  evil dead style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal french kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks but later its shown in all its crazy glory it can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey rips apart trees wraps itself around buildings and coils its slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks it can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth its an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldnt work but it does to fantastic and unforgettable effect so what all this adds up to is a classic example of hong kong movie making a true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie its a film packed with wit invention action monsters martial arts ghosts fantastic ideas lush visuals beautiful music and most important to its enduring charm one of cinemas most moving romances',\n",

       " 'the interesting aspect of the apprentice is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict teamwork skills task dedication and job performance and they certainly dont reveal any hidden agendas in other words a good indicator of potential may be to see a job applicant in action which is the point of the apprentice people vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugar coated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths weaknesses and performance briefly the apprentice involves    job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity a position in real estate magnate donald trumps investment company the apprentice refers to the winner who will win a salaried position learn the art of high stakes deal making from the master himself and presumably gain prime corporate connections the position is a dream come true for those wanting to make more money than the gnp of some foreign countries to entice the candidates trump shows off his private jet his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork his limos his connections to celebrities and other aspects of the life of a billionaire magnate the road to success is not easy the group is divided into two teams that compete against each other each has a corporate sounding name such as versacorps and protg corporation the teams are assigned tasks that entail an entrepreneurial venture such as creating advertising selling merchandise or negotiating teams select a project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills to complete the task if they win the manager receives a lot of credit particularly in the eyes of the final arbiter if they lose the manager may also become the scape goat some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete tasks may involve creating a tv commercial or print ad others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street the tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants they often show immediately who is the most reliable who is the most trustworthy and who is hard working and the tasks also expose who is not a good team player who is inefficient and who seems only out for themselves the tasks invariably reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager how well the manager communicates with the team delegates work organizes time and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome but it does not necessarily predict the winner the single most telling aspect of someones potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager their real abilities as opposed to their self propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a      silk tie or a beautiful makeover leadership qualities and or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only a few minutes those promoting themselves as top notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real life leadership situation it is always easier to toot your own horn than to actually engage in leadership project managers even those on the winning teams often do not formulate a cohesive strategy they often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient more often than not members of an ill strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring it out as they go along and in the long run they end up wasting far more time the winning team gets a taste of the high life such as eating dinner at an exclusive restaurant flying in a private jet and or meeting a celebrity the losing team comes to the dreaded board room where trump hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous youre fired often the project manager is held partially responsible for the teams loss and may be the target of trumps accusatory rhetoric every week at least one person becomes a casualty from the losing team  my least favorite aspect of the apprentice is the board room while the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates the board room often brings out the worst unfortunately the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team even if the competition was close members of the losing team start accusing each other often ruthlessly about who was at fault and sometimes more than one person gets fired i seldom see an under performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room kristi frank and kwame jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her teams losses and received no recognition for this selfless act for me kristi frank and kwame jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates however trump saw kristi as weak and fired her claiming she wasnt standing up for herself which may mean he values ego more than integrity no one should sacrifice their integrity for this kristi frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly isnt that worth as much as winning the strength of the apprentice is also its weakness because team performance is evaluated strictly by winners and losers other evaluation opportunities are overlooked barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams sometimes a losing team exemplifies a high standard of teamwork and efficiency i have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team we americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence',\n",

       " 'the movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly our main actress orked was seen in a chinese language class later in the film she was asked on why by mukhsin that she was sent to learn mandarin her answer was simple for a child she is coz shes already known the malay language well its a bit of a romance one may thought of it but once youve stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it youll notice the typical elements of malaysia the movie basically focuses on    year old orked who met    year old mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boys game running out of players mukhsin who was new in that village was forced to allow orked into the game in which she eagerly showed the male side of her orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie defending mukhsin from much violent encounter with her school bullies throwing one of the bullys bag out from the school bus window throwing punches and kicks on mukhsins brother where after he teased mukhsin and so on and so forth both were awesome buddies and stick closer than that but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way parted the both of them until the day when mukhsin left town now the movie depicts the first love between orked and mukhsin they started out as friends but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards bgr you would notice the changes yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love the different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor the scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that youd be stuck on the screen for a long time you will love the movie for what it is and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes coz it means much more as the movie envelopes around the two love birds it also manages to find its lens towards orkeds parents her mother who was educated in england speaks very good english and in which her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of english which was humor all the way indeed let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie and that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is randomness often more than not we dont learn to laugh at ourselves and when we do we do it at the expense of others it is just like what the movie just follow law by jack neo would have mentioned   often when we are ourselves we dont see the person in us we are but when only when we are in another persons body then only would we learn to see who we really are and that is how humor applies as well more so than just dignity the movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be the other focus of this movie was on how orkeds neighbor a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife and wanted to find another pak koboi as what hes nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend the producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife the wife was a real hurler or kpc as we chinese would call it having interrupting on other peoples business and sending her own daughter to tease orked in words only adults would use after all what goes around comes around and thats probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her in every time being nice to people around you wont hurt at all unless you have an ego to protect but then again whats it worth the movie also centers around mukhsins brother hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night smoking drinking and also finding girls hes the total opposite of mukhsin but thats all perhaps because of family problems both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them i will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all she wanted us me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves movies in a way take us out from our own body places us in the characters position and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it depending on the type and genre of the movie you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you',\n",
       " 'mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a first love story everyone probably has one and this is writer director yasmin ahmads story of hers with a boy called mukhsin we know that her movies have been semi autobiographical of sorts having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen that has her films always exude a warm sincerity and honesty mukhsin is no different and probably the most polished ad confident work to date though i must add as a personal bias that sepet still has a special place in my heart our favourite family is back   pak atan mak inom orked and kak yam though this time we go back to when orked is age    the characters are all younger from the movies weve journeyed with them from rabun to gubra and here sharifah amanis sisters sharifah aryana and sharifah aleya take on the roles of orked and mak inom respectively which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen nevermind that their not playing sibling roles the only constant it seems is kak yam played by adibah noor and even pak atan has hair on his head through mukshin the movie we come full circle with the characters and the world that yasmin has introduced us to we come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more set in the days when theyre still living in their kampung revisited back in rabun where orked attends a chinese school and packs some serious combination of punches and you wonder about that burst of energy in gubra well she had it in her since young the perennial tomboy and doted child of the family she prefers playing with the boys in games rather than mindless masak masak with the girls and favourite outings include going with the family to football matches the arrival of a boy called mukhsin mohd syafie naswip to the village provides a cool peer for orked to hang out and do stuff with   cycling through the villages climbing trees flying kites and as what is desired to be explored the crossing of that line between friendship and romance both beautiful emotions mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story and bring about laughter because some of the incidents we would have experienced it ourselves and sometimes serve as a throwback to our own recollection of childhood in short those scenes screamed fun we observe the life in a typical kampung where some neighbours are very nice while others the nosy parkers and rumour mongers spreading ill gossip stemming from envy there are   additional family dynamics seen one from an immediate neighbour and the other from mukhsins own both of which serve as adequate subplots and contrast to orkeds own as always yasmins movies are filled with excellent music and for mukhsin it has something special the song hujan as penned by her father as well as ne me quitte pas aptly used in the movie given that the yasmins movies to date have been centred around the same characters the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone or when watched and pieced together makes a compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like interracial romance love and forgiveness fans will definitely see the many links in mukhsin back to the earlier movies while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events like that pudgy boy who steals glances at orked and speaking of whys parts of mukhsin too is curiously open which probably is distinctive of yasmins style or deliberately left as such i thought that as a story about childhood recollected from memory then there are details which will be left out for sure and subtly i felt that mukhsin exhibited this perfectly with not so detailed details and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the two another highly recommended movie and a rare one that i feel is suitable for all ages   bring along your kid brother or sister',\n",

       " 'featuring a few of hammers all stars this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of its previous tenants whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective in search of a missing actor story number one which is probably the least impressive of the four deals with a writer and his wife whove just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels he creates a demented character named dominic whos a very creepy looking strangler and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help a sub plot is introduced which frankly didnt really work for me i wont spoil it for you the next story the best in my opinion stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson a man whos moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museumthat deals in the macabre where hes very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past soon thereafter an old friendwho also has a history with this woman is in town for business and drops by to see him the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye story three stars one of my very favoriteschristopher lee who plays john reid after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter well come to find outif she knew what lee did she would have certainly understood the final story is a rather light hearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that hes portrayed several times in his career overall the pacing and direction were very good as was the most of the performances there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance this ones a keeper and comes highly recommended',\n",
       " 'linking story another first time viewing for me and again this is one of the most popular of the amicus anthologies   and its easy to see why though i realize how the films rather meaningless title could be misleading for some i certainly fancied director peter duffells choice   death and the maiden which incidentally is a classical piece by schubert that is heard in the film during the peter cushing episode   a great deal more though the linking device itself is not all that great the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget duffell had to work with the latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and frankly it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him now to the individual stories themselves  method for murder the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but to make up for this its quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times tom adams fictitious villain looking like the long lost brother of boris karloff from the old dark house      also it ends with a satisfactory diabolique type twist and features a fairly intense role for denholm elliott in the lead thats all we need out of it really waxworks for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film peter cushing and joss ackland are both excellent as well as impeccably dressed in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death an ominous hallucination scene with peter cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand and acklands inexplicable inability   or unwillingness   to leave town somewhat recalls the house trapped aristocrats of bunuels the exterminating angel      sweets to the sweet this is perhaps the finest episode of all   with his ambiguous role here christopher lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding nyree dawn porter and the deceptive innocence of chloe franks who appears as lees daughter the films treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling curtain trivia note chloe franks appears as a grown up in the featurette included on the disc and when i saw her i felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldnt quite put my finger on it later on reading her filmography it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long running stage adaptation of agatha christies the mousetrap in londons west end which my brother and i were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the summer of      needless to say we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate   and delicious   portrayal in sheer evil mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile  the cloak a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre while inventing some new ones which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and at one point christopher lee himself jon pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work ingrid pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings geoffrey bayldon made up to look like ernest thesiger also has a memorably quirky bit the silent cinema style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience i suppose   and while some of the humor comes off as heavy handed a la the fearless vampire killers      or theatre of blood      its also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high and highly unusual note  video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory considering i had no other version to compare it with the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect ones enjoyment of the film as for the extras beginning with the audio commentary frankly this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that i can remember listening to jonathan rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director peter duffell to touch on every aspect of the production whereas with some other films youre left rather expecting there to be more and as such its an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed the featurette a rated horror film is a worthwhile effort with peter duffell again at center stage but this time backed up with valid if all too brief contributions from producer max j rosenberg and stars chloe franks ingrid pitt and geoffrey bayldon we also get film notes reviews bios and a poster stills gallery which again are wonderfully assembled with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty   and a welcome one at that',\n",
       " 'from the mind of robert bloch of psycho fame come four tales of twisty terror in this amicus anthology film which while not quite as much fun or scary as i would have liked still provides for some decent genre entertainment its linked by the wrap around story of a highly skeptical scotland yard detective john bennett who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor hes advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place and our film is off and running method for murder has author charles hillyer always delightful denholm elliott haunted by his latest fictional creation who has seemingly come to life this sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments and is capped by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement waxworks stars horror icon peter cushing as retired stockbroker philip grayson who along with old friend neville rogers joss ackland becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum most effective in this episode is the dream sequence although its great as always to watch cushing the final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking sweets to the sweet features another well loved horror star christopher lee as john reid who doesnt treat adorable moppet child jane chloe franks with too much kindness and its up to new companion   tutor ann norton nyree dawn porter to find out why the mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently the film makers wisely dont tip their hand so it comes as more of a genuine shock as we get the full truth of this unhappy family the dying moments are particularly horrific the cloak has the most outright comedy of the four jon pertwee one of many actors to have played the role of dr who over the years is a lot of fun as a vain temperamental horror movie star in fact hes the highlight of this story who infuriated with the lack of quality in his latest low budget film goes out and buys his own cloak said cloak has strange powers which i dare not reveal here sexy ingrid pitt is a welcome presence as pertwees companion one wonderful example of the humor here is a knowing jab taken at none other than christopher lee the wrap up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as detective inspector holloway learns that he should have taken all of the warnings given him more seriously underscored by michael dresss unusual striking and eerie score the house that dripped blood is an entertaining mix of stories while i dont enjoy it quite as much as say tales from the crypt its still good fun capably directed by peter duffell it moves slowly but surely towards each of its chilling conclusions and is certainly a good film of its type     ',\n",
       " 'the house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven amicus horror anthologies if the monster club is included as part of the series this would make eight movies although that movie is very different from the others i look upon the amicus anthologies with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens my feelings for them today are just as strong i spent many years trying to track down this movie the synopses of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy as great as though the movie is i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it it wasnt quite as good as i was led to believe whilst better than its two predecessors its nowhere near as good as its four successors as i shall demonstrate the linking story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants the linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any amicus anthology i couldnt help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor mans version of donald pleasance or ian hendry i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role we could have even had both here   one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent they could and i believe would have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better the movie contains four stories each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house the first story sees denholm elliott as a writer of crime stories he is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing soon after he begins seeing visions of his own creation some excellent direction by peter duffell particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script elliotts performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story the story ends with a semi twist but i couldnt help get the sense of a script which didnt allow it to live up to its potential the second story sees peter cushing move into the house he is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of cushings performance really brings this emotionally moving story to life he is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on cushings loneliness this is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside cushings mind anyway cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end joss ackland plays cushings rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great peter cushing the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee   my favourite horror actor of all time   move into the house with his daughter mr lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all he even brings in a school governess to educate her the governess played by nyree dawn porter in another of her superb performances tries to find out what is wrong without giving too much away i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role christopher lees presence is truly electrifying in every scene hes in chloe franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and thats what matters jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house he is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies seeing everything as cheap and fake particularly the costumes so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role geoffrey bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak when pertwee puts the cloak on he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire pertwees performance has to be seen to be believed it truly is hilarious ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger the linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house the rest youll be able to work out for yourself as weak as the linking story is it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending im convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesnt lie with peter duffell the director who really does his best with what hes got i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies overall the house that dripped blood despite its flaws is a must see for fans of the amicus anthologies fans of other amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out youll enjoy it',\n",
       " 'four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical scotland yard investigator holloway john bennett as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped blood one can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is the house that dripped blood this seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers incredibly the number of depictions of violence on screen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence in a rare feature of early seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless from the faultless performances of the star studded cast featuring the legendary peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of peter duffell and master of the macabre writer robert bloch the author of the novel psycho the only real complaints that one may have with the house that dripped blood are the somewhat asinine plot twists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoyment the first segment entitled method for murder tells the story of charles hillyer denholm elliott a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel while working on the novel hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality elliotts performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability the key to this segment as with the others is the mystery surrounding the events that take place the viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of dominic is merely a hallucination a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there duffells direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthralling the following segment features peter cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house during a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in while there he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him cushings character philip is then joined by his friend neville joss ackland who also wishes to visit the museum much to the dismay of philip in this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark there is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story duffells direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting waxworks is still a delightful entry into the film waxworks is followed by what is in my opinion the greatest of the four segments  sweets to the sweet christopher lee stars as john reid the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny ann norton nyree dawn porter however john appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family sweets to the sweet is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place this is the best example of how duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack sweets to the sweet is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease personally i believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and i would give this segment a rare       the film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in jon pertwee and ingrid pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie pertwees character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries however strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst this segment which places the inspector amongst the events is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is in a way what makes the story so enjoyable unfortunately there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features horror buffs should definitely look out for pertwees brief comment on bela lugosis and christopher lees portrayal of dracula this slightly comical and light hearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspense driven horror to sum up the house that dripped blood is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast great stories and above par direction there are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely my rating for the house that dripped blood      ',\n",
       " 'horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies im not very fond of them myself but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of british horror cinema the house that dripped blood is a horror omnibus featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a scotland yard officer by an estate agent this film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt whom horror fans will recognise as one of lees co stars in the greatest british horror film of all time the wicker man the first segment of the film titled method for murder tells the story of a horror storywriter whose creation a strangler named dominic is brought to life by his own imagination this story builds suspense very well through his girlfriend he and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination this story certainly isnt very original but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and its final twist which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise the second story titled waxworks stars peter cushing and is my least favourite of the four this tale follows the story of phillip grayson cushing a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in inside he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess quite what the womans relationship with phillip entailed is never really explained but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details cushing is later joined by his friend neville rogers played by joss ackland and thats when the tale really starts to pick up the setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isnt a new idea the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent      horror film chamber of horrors although the one here isnt as grand as the one in the aforementioned film the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia brought about by the limited area of the museum peter cushing is always interesting to watch and seeing him avoid an axe wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan despite being my least favourite this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down the film continues with sweets for the sweet which is without doubt the best of the omnibus this story stars the legendary christopher lee as a seemingly overprotective father the beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out it leaves the audience guessing we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter but we dont know who or what it is christopher lee as usual portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll and the fact that she isnt allowed to go to school or have any toys the card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end epitomised by the truly chilling line in which lee tells his babysitter that he is in fact afraid of his daughter the ending to this section is superbly played out in my opinion its one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told and will stay with you long after the end credits roll the omnibus finishes with the cloak which is definitely the most comedic of the four this tale is about a hammy horror film star that unimpressed by his latest films technical side goes out and buys himself a cloak naturally this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak unlike the other three tales this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs that is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film the ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film also look out for the little jibe regarding christopher lee in dracula a nice touch i think overall if you want a horror omnibus you really cant go wrong with the house that dripped blood the third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed',\n",

       " 'another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin an event i had not known of that began in late february      the details are given in an addendum that follows this review the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in new york city in the present here a well off non observant jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual she goes even further demanding that her daughters non jewish fianc leave the house the distressed daughter hannah maria schrader then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii in berlin her mother then   years old had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman hannah drops everything goes to berlin and finds this woman lena fischer now    hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story it all seems rather too pat the film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of      that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs fischer at    played magnificently by katja riemann a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian martin feifel a jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse site the narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again while scenes in the present are color saturated the      scenes are washed out strong on blue gray tones the quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta new german cinemas most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress the story of the protest is told simply only one feature is lacking that would have helped still text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual raps it is too long but i found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained i found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction the very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward i awoke often later in the night i saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film for me that happens rarely in german and english my rating      b  seen on          if youd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites add the rosenstrasse protest swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the final roundup in the national capital      to      jews mostly men married to non jewish women were herded into rosenstrasse     a welfare office for the jewish community in central berlin because these jews had german relatives many of them highly connected adolf eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied poland normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the east but before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever growing numbers perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third reich joseph goebbels the gauleiter governor or district leader of berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nations public morale on both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the womens actions rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the final solution goebbels with hitlers concurrence released the rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty five of them who already had been sent to auschwitz  to both hitler and goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable but they were mistaken almost all of those released from rosenstrasse survived the war the women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction adapted from an article posted at the university of south florida website a teachers guide to the holocaust',\n",
       " 'rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions which could have kept away many film goers looking for a pianist similar plot fortunately von trotta a good screenwriter opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary aryan german rather from a jewish standpoint rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims the pace of the film is introspective poignantly slow meditative besides the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been deftly crafted rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece and some narrative flaws are well discerned another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters nevertheless this film is worth seeing finally rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in german films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish pasttrend that includes such excellent films as nowhere in africa and recently the controversial downfall i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images',\n",

       " 'by      dw griffith had been directing films for the biograph company for about a year and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker the sealed room is a very interesting    minute short a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen poes      short story the cask of amontillado and concerns a powerful king who conceives a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to punish his wifes infidelity set in medieval times the sealed room begins with the king arthur v johnson overseeing the construction of a windowless room from a sequestered dove cote the idea being that he and his wife marion leonard will have a completely private place to enjoy each others company he is obviously very much in love with her always showing his affection this latest act the crowning achievement of his endearment however unbeknownst to the king his wife has fallen in love with the royal minstrel henry b walthall during one romantic liaison inside the specially built room the wife and the minstrel are discovered and the heartbroken king conceives a means of getting his retribution on the ignorant couple silently he orders his workmen to seal off the only doorway with stone and mortar slowly descending into cackling insanity as each new stone is placed down dw griffith always had an eye for acute detail and the sealed room is an excellent early example of this the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable at the time the director was also pioneering methods of creating suspense and i must admit that as the film progressed i became fixated on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers in the early minutes griffith restricts his shots to lengthy long takes from a stationary camera as was usual at the time but soon  parallel to the progressively darker subject matter  he alters his editing tactics in a fascinating way though he may not have invented the technique griffith was crucial in popularising the use of cross cutting  that is alternating between different events occurring at the same time not only does this create a sense of continuity but it also maximises the level of suspense since we as the audience are well aware not only of the kings ghastly actions but also that the wife and the minstrel are oblivious to it all despite these innovations the sealed room suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era the entire film takes place in just two rooms with footage captured from a total of just three positions and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect however at least in the case of arthur v johnson his overplaying actually contributed to recognising the escalating madness of the betrayed king a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone their panicked reactions accompanied by the silent maniacal cackling of the king serve very well to create an impending sense of claustrophobia i did think however that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly',\n",

       " 'as we all know the sub genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded simply being excessively raunchy isnt enough anymore ive seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days coming into the    year old virgin i knew basically what to expect i did see the commercials after all is it true that if you dont use it you lose it what i didnt expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development theres still the weird off the wall characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and theres still enough inappropriate language to sink noahs ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message the main character andy is unfortunately for me a person i can relate to in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater      he has a poster for the movie on his wall and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology andy doesnt want to buy a car because he prefers his bike most importantly of all andy is a nice person he doesnt swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them combine all these factors and everybody begins to think hes a serial murderer its like my life story the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go its quite simple it deals with andys relationship with trish for a long time and we all know whats going to happen in the end sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know whats going to happen in the end and i assure you it does these are definitely small stains on the movie but theres so much good here that i can easily ignore its few faults when i say good i mean bad of course this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad for the most part i think it succeeded there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish or the scene where andy goes with his trishs daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ooh como se llama an interesting little note about that scene the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part actually since were talking about steve carell id like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didnt even know who he was prior to seeing this film i was just so impressed by his writing acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles this man has talent it the    year old virgin proves that to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see im glad that i did too since its probably one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching its not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather its a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance now excuse me while i go puke my guts out i cant believe i just wrote that my review from frider waves http  friderwavescom indexphppage virgin',\n",

family who grew up with lila and buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small new england town ann immediately becomes enamored of harris which adds a complication to the fact that lila has always been in love with harris and continues to be buddy also is in love with harris but being      he has redirected that homosexual desire for harris to his good friend ann for he cannot admit to

make the whole movie worth watching on lilas wedding day ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss lilas misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love this scene is repeated fifty years later when lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend ann to talk about the lives they have lived in this latter scene streep and redgrave are enthralling the other memorable scene   at least to me   is when buddy declares his love for ann hugh dancy as buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings his performance is superior chick flick yes a very special film with unbelievable acting directing and scenery definitely i cannot recommend evening too much',\n",

       " 'waqt is a perfect example of a chicken soup not exactly for your soul the broth unfortunately has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excess dilution and garnishing that went into its making whats surprising and disappointing about waqt is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clichs of hindi cinema in his first venture but who in his second outing gives in for all the stereotype film formulas while vipul shah had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in aankhen he just fails to induce life in the entire packaging of waqt that is based on something as conceivable as a father son relationship adopted from a gujarati play aavjo vhala fari malishu waqt does have a sensible storyline with a social message to back up a mature look on the father son relationship a fathers unconditional love towards his son and a sons responsibility towards his family ishwar chand sharawat amitabh bachchan who has established his entire empire on his own from the scratch leads an affluent life with his wife sumitra shefali shah their only son aditya akshay kumar never had the need to strive for anything since he got everything tailor made and spoon fed in life ishwars pampering has only spoil him all the more aditya dreams to turning into a superstar but does nothing to make his dreams come true in the meanwhile he marries his ladylove mitali priyanka chopra ishwar hopes that marriage will make aditya a more responsible man but he is disappointed aditya is still at his blithe best leading a carefree life the endurance limit finally collapses when ishwar expels aditya from his house the sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now expecting wife baffles aditya he has no option left but to strive for the livelihood of his wife and his unborn kid he starts turning into an independent man but the rift in the relationship between him and his father grows the story is simplistic while the uncomplicated screenplay has a very elementary approach one can easily identify and relate with the credible characters of both the father and the son if you are not one of the two you at least might have come across individuals like them somewhere in real life add to it director vipul shahs easy handling of the screenplay with a family affair like this any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings as per the cinematic laws of bollywood family dramas turning the film into a compulsive tearjerker however shah excels in the effortless handling of emotions for most part of the film clear cut example of his unpretentious direction is palpable in the pre interval scene where the father expels the son from his house in a rather frivolous manner the purpose of the scene is achieved without blotting a brunt on the audiences brains ditto for the scene in the second half wherein the now separated father son have a flippant conversation thats what differentiates waqt from a kabhi kushi ghum or an ek rishtaa and in fact places it one level high in terms of treatment but after gaining all the distinction points one may wonder where does waqt still fail in the problem lies in the fact that while waqt distinguishes itself from the others in its league in terms of treatment it gives in to the glitches in the terms of packaging what with the director forcing in song n dance every now and then in the first half theres a johar kinda shaadi song a chopra kinda holi song a father son disco dandia song a dream song and a dream come true song inducing sufficient yawns in the viewer picture this the father has just ousted the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in moroccan mountains with his wife out of place out of reason and the audience out of seat the film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half the director has wasted too much waqt on unnecessary elements the much talked about dog chase sequence isnt bad but is not redeeming either however akshay kumars taandav dance is simply ridiculous imagine he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this unintentionally hilarious histrionic add to it the climax set at the finals of the star hunt where the son bursts out with emotions thats so archetypal also the editing pattern could have been reversed to conceal the fathers reason for the change in attitude towards his son anu maliks music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings santosh thundiiayils camera work is competent enough though not much demanding aatish kapadia has come up with some good dialogs for dramatic moments boman irani and rajpal yadav make up or the light moments in the film very efficiently while rajpal yadav has been going overboard with his comic histrionics in many films off lately this time he underplays his character and is completely restrained his deadpan expressions are perfectly complimented with bomans over the top histrionics shefali shah is convincing in the mothers role not to be taken as a censure but she is flawless in both playing and looking her character priyanka is gorgeous and performs her part well of course the major applause deserves are akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his doting father intentionally berates him to make him aware of his responsibilities though bachchan goes a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes his brilliance strikes throughout the film to sum up waqt is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional but the final recipe somehow isnt as much appetizing',\n",

       " '  simple rules for dating my teenage daughter had an auspicious start the supremely talented tom shadyac was involved in the project this meant that the comedy would be nothing less of spectacular and thats exactly what happened the show remains one of the freshest funniest wittiest shows made in a very long time every line facial expression casting choice scene all wreaked of perfection there was not one episode after which i thought man that wasnt as good as the rest each one was a standout again this is the kind of perfectionism that weve come to expect from tom for those who dont know tom shadyac is the director of ace ventura first movie the nutty professor first one and liar liar quite a rsum hes a producer here not a director but his magic touch is felt in every episodethe family consists of the father paul hennessy john ritter nice slightly neurotic can be a pushover from time to time works as a sports writer john unfortunately passed away in      leaving a fond memory and near sure cancellation contemplations by the suits the mother cate katey sagal come on who didnt fall in love with katey when she played peg on married with children al bundy was our hero we viewers gave him the respect and love he never had but without pegs nonchalant parasitic lazy lifestyle al wouldve probably been just another chicago dad instead of the mess that peg life actually caused him to be katey was a milf back then and still is a brune now instead of a redhead and just as buxom as ever cate is the conservative mom and loving wife i know it sounds boring but comedically she fits perfectly  the ditzy blonde daughter bridget played to perfection by kaley cuoco almost never has an idiot been played so well aside of gob on arrested development bridget may well be a shoe in for any awards given to this archetype bridget is shallow self centered not very bright and a tad slutty in his look she plays the dumb blonde role better than absolutely anyone imo perfection one of the high points of the show the overlooked geeky daughter kerry amy davidson a brune and a geek she gets no love from life or circumstances feels overlooked under appreciated and neglected most of the time shes bridgets younger sister in reality shes older than her and the twos extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes to much of our amusement the son rory martin spanjers was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter then john passes new characters come and rory is not the wise cracking verbal trouble maker that he used to that went mostly to david spades character  those characters were the main ones at the time of john ritter unfortunately enough the insanely hilarious larry miller one of my favorites did not get lots of screen time he played pauls co worker competitor after an aortic dissection cost ritter his life in      september   th the show was on hiatus for a while no one thought it could come back but it did later on with a couple of new additions this began the second phase of the show and the new characters were the strict confident school principal ed adam arkin i saw adam here and there on talk shows this was the first time that i saw him do anything impressed is the word i use his performance was very impressive sad he wasnt brought in earlier he also plays cates potential love interest after paul passes the gradual progress towards this point which wouldve sounded crazy at the beginning earns the creators lots of praise it was done slowly carefully and excellently with constant respect paid to the paul ritter the attitude grandpa jim egan james garner a surprisingly welcome addition to the series he was cannon fodder for endless old jokes mainly by the    year old unemployed wise cracking half brother of the mom cj played to insanely funny heights by david spade i knew spade was funny i just didnt know he was this funny somehow spades very familiar presence is sensed inside his character as opposed to a separable character which is understandable since hes a comic and hes on a comedy show this eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lots of material from david spades appearances in movies talk shows and functions award shows etc and delivering a superb impersonation of spades voice and comedy style except that it is spade by that i mean you realize hes not trying to play someone else or a whole new character hes being the goofy funny spade weve come to know and he takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top every line he uttered every sarcasm he begot all classics literally spade was crazy funny so so funny the shows humor and drama were both upped after the show was back but audiences thought john passed it aint gonna be the same anymore this is understandable considering we are talking about a group of people american viewers who gave yes dear a free ride but caused andy richter controls the universe to be cancelled in no time as the shows quality increased its ratings declined soon it was no more sadly  and i saved the best for last fans of married with children are in for a treat and boy what a treat it was i still shiver just remembering it its a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it even if i legitimately do it under the spoiler pretext suffice it to say that its something youll never

       " 'the shop around the corner      is a pleasant romantic comedy not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation by      director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm and his famed lubitsch touch had become a sparkling commercial trademark this film was planned for a      release but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming rather than substituting either of his main stars lubitsch decided to postpone production in the meantime directing greta garbo in ninotchka      when it was finally completed the shop around the corner appears to have been met with relative indifference receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role time nevertheless has betrayed the films massive and enduring influence with high profile remakes including in the good old summertime      and youve got mail      at its surface one might assume the shop around the corner to simply be the story of two lovers klara novak sullavan and alfred kralik stewart who love each other without knowing it however lubitschs film runs much deeper than that its the story of matuschek and company a stylish gift shop in budapest and the various human relationships that make the store such a close knit family when store owner hugo matuschek frank morgan begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife we witness the breakdown of two families both at home and at work theres absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states  perhaps in the blustery streets of new york  but lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in europe the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful personal touch to the film  in fact even as i write this review im beginning to appreciate the story even more sullavan and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles but i think that its the supporting cast that really make the film each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable i especially liked how lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards hugo matuschek who in any other film would have been restricted to an underdeveloped two dimensional portrayal matuschek may have lost the love of his family but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees and you feel a heartwarming glow when in the bitter cold of a christmas eve snowstorm he finds companionship in a freckle faced young errand boy charles smith this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy wilders later creations for example boom boom jackson in the fortune cookie      or carlo carlucci in avanti      of course it doesnt really need saying but billy wilder learned from the best',\n",
       " 'the shop around the corner is one of the sweetest and most feel good romantic comedies ever made theres just no getting around that and its hard to actually put ones feeling for this film into words its not one of those films that tries too hard nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end in fact all its charm is innate contained within the characters and the setting and the plot which is highly believable to boot its easy to think that such a love story as beautiful as any other ever told  could  happen to you a feeling you dont often get from other romantic comedies however sweet and heart warming they may be  alfred kralik james stewart and clara novak margaret sullavan dont have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop matuschek   co hes been working in for the past nine years asking for a job they clash from the very beginning mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when its opened  he thinks its a ludicrous idea she makes one big sell of it and gets hired their bickering takes them through the next six months even as they both unconsciously of course fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through po box     this would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on except that the shop around the corner is expertly fleshed out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters from the fatherly but lonely hugo matuschek frank morgan himself who learns that his shop really is his home pirovitch felix bressart kraliks sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion smarmy pimp du jour vadas joseph schildkraut who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous kralik and ambitious errand boy pepi katona william tracy who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for matuschek   co the unpretentious love story between dear friends is played out in this little shop in budapest hungary in which kraliks unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds to be along its nice that everyone gets a story in this film the supporting characters are well developed and matuscheks own journey in life is almost as touching as the one alfred and clara share his invitation to new errand boy rudy charles smith for christmas eve dinner made in the whirling beautiful snow of a hungarian winter makes the audience glad that he is not alone we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isnt this films business to tell  aside from the love story i must say that james stewart is truly one of the best things about this film he doesnt play the full fledged jimmy stewart persona in this film c f mr smith goes to washington for that in fact alfred kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind hes rather a brusque man in fact with little hint until perhaps the very end of the aw shucks down home boyish charm stewart would soon come to patent when he finds out before clara that they have been corresponding in secret in fact kralik doesnt fess up  he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade especially since he quickly realises given his stormy relationship with clara as boss and underling that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself his description to clara of the fictional matthias popkin what a name who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme but also his way of proving that the letters dont reveal all there is to a man just as her letters dont reveal all there is to her stewart plays this role perfectly  he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever clara insults mr kralik as she is often wont to do even and especially to his face and yet one believes underneath the brusqueness and professionalism that he  could  reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer  hope  as he eventually does  special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well margaret sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film but she really comes into her own in the closing shop scene on christmas eve when she almost gets her heart broken again by alfreds most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart frank morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous hugo matuschek driven to nervous breakdown the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of    years does not want to grow old with him and felix bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal pirovitch wonderfully a lubitsch regular since he appears as a hilarious russian ambassador in ninotchka  of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend alfred get the christmas present the latter  really  wants a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box clara is so hung up on  ernst lubitsch really does himself proud with this film  for example the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the matuschek shop is well worth the effort right down to the hungarian names on the door the wares and the cash register and so on but even though lubitsch chose to have the story set in hungary the setting is actually universal it could happen anywhere it could happen to you therein lies the charm of this simple story these believable characters who really  are  people the snow on christmas eve is real as well or at least as real as lubitsch could make it he had snow machines brought in at great expense it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated no not even in a remake like youve got mail   this  is really the jimmy stewart christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about its a wonderful life not to detract from the merits of that other film but thered be no harm and in fact a lot of good done in watching the shop around the corner this christmas instead its sweet funny charming and stewart is impeccable in his role we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could',\n",

star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in   nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles youll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheauxs films swing is the best the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shame adding further info popular blues singer of the   s and   s cora green is the focus of the film shes mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hot cha entertainer in the   s and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess shes playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but thats not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between theres great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing theres even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them theres even a scene where theres blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold move this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business no these early race films may not be the best cant be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black persons eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films werent the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldnt afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race film makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some werent great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most werent good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actors actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didnt want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think youll be able to spot the true actors actresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films arent the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didnt start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films arent the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching sunday sinners dark manhattan

       " 'i am a huge fan of vonneguts work and im very fond of this movie but i wouldnt say that this is a film of the mother night that i read when people say that vonnegut is unfilmable two things come to my mind one is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively easy targets for his satire this means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and i have high hopes for the version of bluebeard now in production amazing to think that an innocent piece like vonneguts sirens of titan would probably have been the equivalent of r rated if filmed when it was published back in the   s for its violence language and sexual and thematic content though its a tragedy that nobodys come up yet with a filmable script for it and in the present economic climate i also hope some director out there is looking closely at jailbird galapagos and hocus pocus the other thing is his narrative style heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny it seems impossible to objectify and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like talkovers vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work himself as author narrator to its credit breakfast of champions the movie tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains as did another turkey made from a vonnegut novel slapstick in an even more spectacular way still theres nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of vonnegut and mother night is an excellent example of how as another reviewer put it a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this but so much of the humour is lost that though its the same plot its not really from the same novel i read if it had been id probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it for a reader of the novel i think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable the end of the film however is truly poignant and i think one of the films successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that youve watched someone walk a razors edge between good and evil and the jury is still out standing alone and of itself its well worth a look technically there are some minor but glaring errors notably in continuity and it too often looks drab and theatrical but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness the acting in general is of a high order even if maybe the dialogue is by todays standards a little stilted it survives quite well watching back to back with slaughterhouse   and there is actually quite a bit more good filmed vonnegut out there mostly versions of his short stories   harrison bergeron who am i this time and some other things like of course the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play happy birthday wanda june also there was an interesting piece  if it still exists done in the   s called between time and timbuktu which vonnegut apparently didnt like much although he was involved in its production because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality he said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the hg wells tale the island of dr moreau but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his work but if the films dont make you want to go to the superior source material theyre not doing their job as the man said more or less the big show is inside your head',\n",

but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant patten david burkeof dr watson fame to show him to his room as fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that fanshawes visit will entail the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking cleaning and maintenance for him fanshawe is a fussy sort very neat and precise with everything having its place whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit so he asks the squire for a replacement pair the squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house so he obliges and walks fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages there the squire directs him to points of interest including gallows hill where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the squire describes as a ruin but fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isnt he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants fanshawe doesnt have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched he feels a presence he begins to see moving shadows in the woods startled he runs home over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the squire patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for itthe binoculars they used to belong to a local man called baxter whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from gallows hill boiling them up for some concoction or other baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night the late squire had acquired his belongings including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area these etchings fascinate fanshawe as they portray the abbey he seen through his binoculars but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of henry vii and so it would be impossible for baxter to have drawn the sketches never the less they are signed and dated by baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power that night he has horrifically vivid dreams when he wakes he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession as darkness falls the squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above gallows hill they quicken their speed but will they be in time to help or save fanshawe from his destiny the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in      with the ice house they were for the most part based on the work of the great mr james in      and      the series was revived briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum thus upping the tension and mystery the autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles the idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see may even have influenced lex de la iglesia in his film la habitacin del nio      of the following year with which it bears striking similarity i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers something that doesnt happen much these days i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow plenty of time is given even within its brief    minutes running time for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade',\n",

       " 'it would require the beauty and eloquence of shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat nevertheless ill give it a go as far as adaptations of hamlet go this one is already at a better starting point than all other versions since it encompasses the entire play still this is no guarantee for a first rate movie or even a good one usually im not much for movies that are overlong and the trend that seems to be prevalent in hollywood today namely that movies should be at least two hours long preferably three is one that hopefully wont last long few stories are strong enough to withstand such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting making a four hour long movie and keeping it interesting is no small undertaking but kenneth branagh pulls it off with flying colours he has managed to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie i was completely engrossed from start to finish the cast is excellent with kenneth branagh himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance he manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on shakespearean verse to catch the myriad of emotions that are waging inside him kate winslet was a positive surprise i must say i didnt know what to expect really ive always liked her well enough as an actor but wasnt sure she could pull off playing shakespeare well she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance she is the best ophelia i have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful other brilliant performances are derek jacobi as claudius richard briers as polonius and nicholas farrell as horatio to name but a few i liked the fact that branagh used some internationally more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles i especially enjoyed the sparring between hamlet and the gravedigger played by billy crystal the setting of the play in the   th century gives a welcome change to the usually gloomier gothic settings it is overall much lighter than other versions ive seen more colourful and lavish but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play it is exceptional stylish and aesthetically pleasing a definite delight to the eye and other senses as well the music by patrick doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie one can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this i am shocked and appalled that this exquisite work of art did not win an academy award for best picture even more so that it wasnt even nominated there is no way there was a better movie made that year or any other year for that matter this is as close to perfection as you can hope to get to sum up a stunning work of pure genius and i cannot see how anyone could top this my hats off to you mr branagh',\n",
       " 'william shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play not only is it the best movie version of it but its also the only complete version of hamlet kenneth branaghs hamlet is simply genius not only because it was written by shakespeare but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing even if it went just over four hours we all know the story of the prince of denmark and his plot to avenge his fathers death so i wont go into the details of the story i will however tell you that the best part of this hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography but the actors interpretations of each character i doubt youll find a better polonius than richard briers delicious portrayal plus you cant go wrong with julie christie and jack lemmon also derek jacobi a regular among shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to hamlet of course we must talk about kenneth branagh he wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with shakespeare henry v he outdoes himself with hamlet sure oliviers presence was captivating but i think branaghs performance is wonderful when you watch him on screen its almost as if he knew exactly how shakespeare wanted the role to be played how he wasnt nominated for an oscar is a total mystery at least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for screenplay i guess they know good writing when they see it though  all in all youll never find a more rich and lavish production of the bards best play to say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement if you love this play and are a fan of shakespeare you definitely need to check this movie out even if you dont really care for shakespeare the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film you may not think youll be able to sit through all of it at once but youll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more',\n",
       " 'a lot of people dont think branaghs hamlet film is all that good but i must admit i think it is splendid like virtually every production of shakespeare it has problems and it has had to make hard choices not all of which work out the thing about the secret doors everywhere for instance simply doesnt work that element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming this is the biggest problem with this production and while its a biggie im also inclined to say that its the only problem almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully all right so branagh is a mite too old for the title role and the relationship with ophelia seems a little forced and he gets too hysterical at times but thats it no other complaints even with these faults i think this version is a seminal one and if its not as powerful a drama as it ought to be its every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be we get the complete text of the longest version of the play innovatively and expensively brought to the screen mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices   even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with but in a staging of shakespeare it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language for that one must delve into the print versions of the plays all the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic incl jack lemmon julie christie as gertrude is surely one of the best ever and even the american actors are astounding esp charlton heston as the player king   who would have thought it a story is going around that heston once played hamlet on stage and when a critic in the front row couldnt stand his hammy acting and said out loud this is terrible heston reportedly retorted right from the stage well i didnt write this crap of course it may not be true but its a funny story   and if true a bold and ironic choice for branagh to include heston here robin williams as young ozric is perhaps not young enough for the part but he makes it a comical one which is warranted overall it is a very well produced version with most of the key scenes being to my mind supremely memorable of course i watched this movie just as i was becoming interested in shakespeare and around the same time as luhrmanns formidable romeo juliet and it made a great impression on me which must account for some of my fondness for it all things considered i must pronounce branaghs hamlet to be my favorite one with derek jacobis      bbc version a close second i probably like branaghs shakespeare work more than most finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text in the world of shakespeare acting the two brightest luminaries remain olivier and branagh and while olivier is the superior actor branagh brings shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice and transforms it into churlish easy going populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity branagh i believe brings out a truer shakespeare than the world has yet seen and so    out of    for an absolutely tremendous hamlet',\n",

       " 'this was the second of two filmed hamlets in the nineties the first being franco zeffirellis starring mel gibson from      zeffirellis version like laurence oliviers from      was based upon an abridged version of the play with much of shakespeares original text being cut i have never seen tony richardsons      version but as that ran to less than two hours shorter even than zeffirellis i presume that was also abridged kenneth branagh was attempting something much more ambitious  a film based on the complete text of the play with a running time of around four hours with his henry v branagh claimed oliviers crown as the cinemas leading shakespearean confirming his claim with his brilliant much ado about nothing a rare example of a great film based on a shakespeare comedy hamlet was his third shakespeare film as director he also acted as iago in oliver parkers      othello and as one might expect it is very different to much ado the earlier film shot in a villa in the hills of tuscany and the beautiful surrounding countryside is a joyous summertime film about everything that makes life worth living hamlet by contrast is set in the depths of winter the flowers in the description of ophelias death suggest that shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer the look of the film is particularly striking both sumptuous and chilly it was filmed at blenheim palace possibly englands most grandiose stately home but also a rather forbidding one the snowy exterior scenes are cold and wintry the interior ones formal and elaborate the action is updated to the mid nineteenth century the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms there is a contrast here with zeffirellis film where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone the play is dominated by images of corruption and decay branaghs intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying something rotten in the state of denmark the film is notable for the large number of big name actors some of them in very minor roles blink and you might miss john gieldgud or judi dench apparently an all star cast was required by the production company who were nervous about a four hour film some of the imported hollywood stars such as robin williams osric did not really come off but others like charlton hestons player king or billy crystals first gravedigger played their parts very well yorick normally only seen as a skull is here seen in flashback played by the british comedian ken dodd brian blessed who often plays jovial characters is cast against type as the ghost and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening of the major characters perhaps the weakest was kate winslets ophelia branaghs leading lady in his first two shakespeare films was his then wife emma thompson but their marriage ended in divorce in      i did however find myself wishing that thompson had been cast in the role although winslet came into her own in the ophelias mad scenes she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane i preferred helena bonham carter in zeffirellis version richard briers plays polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool julie christie also brings dignity to the role of gertrude there is no attempt here as there was with gibson and glenn close in the zeffirelli version to suggest an incestuous attachment between her and hamlet an interpretation which owes more to freud than it does to shakespeare the age difference between christie and branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son which was certainly not the case with close and gibson oliviers gertrude eileen herlie was bizarrely thirteen years younger than him branagh stated that his intention in restoring those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to reinforce the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy much stress is placed upon the war with norway and the norwegian prince fortinbras  a subplot ignored altogether by zeffirelli this emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of claudius sometimes played as a one dimensional villain there is something about derek jacobis performance which suggests that claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances but that he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust he could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother but chose to rule as a bad king although he is tormented by guilt he can see no way to make amends for the evil he has done branagh a wonderfully fluent speaker of shakespeares verse is superb in the main role like gibson he has little time for the old concept of hamlet as indecisive passive and melancholy his is an active physical energetic hamlet something best shown in his fatal duel with laertes his guiding principle is not world weary despair but an active disgust with evil and corruption it was a gamble for branagh to make a four hour epic and the film did not do well at the box office it was however praised by many critics james berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic my own opinion is that whatever the financial returns may have been branaghs gamble paid off in artistic terms by concentrating on the full text he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of shakespeares most complex play when i reviewed his much ado i said it was the greatest ever film of a shakespeare comedy his hamlet may just be the greatest ever film of a shakespeare tragedy      ',\n",

       " 'the image of movie studios being financially driven instead of creatively is not without truth in fact its more true than false this begs the question why castle rock entertainment allowed kenneth branagh to create a full length uncut version of hamlet with his complete creative control among other things of course branagh had to agree to some concessions a star studded cast and a    hour version for wider release but why would the film studio allow branagh to spend money on a   hour version that they knew few would see could they have at least in this case had enough respect for the material and branaghs vision to create something for only a few people that is not a question that i can answer whatever the reason this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching hamlet everyone knows the story so i will not spend much time on that however unlike other productions of the play stage included this is a completely uncut production which has never been done before according to some shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut leaving the decision of what to include to the directors discretion that being said i have no doubt that had he been able to see it the bard would have been overjoyed with branaghs production the film is top heavy with film stars although most have mere bit parts all play their parts equally well i would have thought branagh too old to play the part of hamlet and while he still may be his performance more than makes up for it hamlet is a complex part displaying every emotion from grief to anger happiness to madness and everything in between branagh nailed it derek jacobi is terrific as the wily claudius whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion his unique voice is perfect for the role julie christie is also very good as gertrude hamlets caring mother who doesnt realize what is going on until late in the game the classical actors are cast in bit parts judi dench is on for all of    seconds and has no lines but at least theyre in it surprisingly no one takes this to heart everyone gives it their all and it shows special mention has to go to jack lemmon and billy crystal who are excellent robin williams is a little too silly but hes not bad his part is pretty small anyway yet this is undeniably branaghs show he adapted one of the most famous plays in history and in so doing he took on a whale of a project its impressive that he got it done but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement what i really liked about this film is that you dont have to be a shakespeare scholar to enjoy it as most people know shakespeare is difficult to digest but branagh and his cast understand this hamlet is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting this is a must see for anyone and everyone it may be four hours long but its definitely worth it',\n",

him to be type casted during the   s in the same way boris karloffs performance in james whales frankenstein transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster of course it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen and the movie that united them was     s the black cat this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade and director lambert hillyers mix of horror and science fiction the invisible ray is another of those minor classics they did in those years in the invisible ray dr janos rukh boris karloff is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planets past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda while showing his invention to his colleagues dr felix benet bela lugosi and sir francis stevens walter kingsford they discover that thousands of years ago a meteor hit in what is now nigeria after this marvelous discovery dr rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor this expedition wont be any beneficial for rukh as during the expedition his wife diane frances drake will fall in love with ronald drake frank lawton an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition however rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip as hell be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor written by john colton who previously did the script for werewolf of london the invisible ray had its roots on an original sci fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up one element that makes the invisible ray to stand out among other horror films of that era is the way that colton plays with morality through the story that is there arent exactly heroes and villains in the classic style but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices in many ways the invisible ray is a modern tragedy about obsessions guilt and revenge a seasoned director of low budget b movies filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make   films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles thanks to his experience working with limited resources hillyers films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains and the invisible ray was not an exception while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films hillyers movie effectively captures the essence of coltons script as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci fi finally a word must be said about hillyers use of special effects for an extremely low budget film they look a lot better than the ones in several a movies of the era as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality as the films protagonist boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes as his colleague dr benet bela luogis is simply a joy to watch stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was as rukhs wife frances drake is extremely effective truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress still two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh and beulah bondi as lady arabella as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time making unforgettable their supporting roles frank lawton is also good in his role but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast if one judges this movie under todays standards its very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience however that would be a mistake as despite its low budget it is remarkably well done for its time on the top of that considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept its ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr rukh and the cold dr benet as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the frankenstein movies nor the elegant suspense of the black cat lambert hillyers the invisible ray is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures catalog of horror films with one of the most interesting screenplays of   s horror this mixture of suspense horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had boris karloff and bela

       " 'there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordans ned kelly film did initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations and decided to see it for myself since then i have acquired both the video and soundtrack and have to say that after several viewings i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film it is also wonderful to see something australian i appreciate its down to earth quality that if you ask me is a rarity as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films this film proves that you dont necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point the cast was a bonus including a variety of well known and might i add good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters it is interesting to note that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what and how they only said so many lines however if any criticism is due it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded in reality these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history for example on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much much more to the relationship between joe byrne and aaron sheritt and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron sheritts efforts alone that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery yes this is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention i feel that in this case this is the only limitation however i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation it certainly inspired me to look more closely so watch it and decide for yourself you might not like it at all thats your opinion and thats fine maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience for me id call it a breath of fresh air',\n",

       " 'the shining is a weird example of adaptation it has very little in common with the source novel written by stephen king yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror masters work this is due to two factors stanley kubricks masterful direction and jack nicholsons chilly acting nicholson plays jack torrance a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place he claims a nice isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family jack his wife wendy shelley duvall and their five year old son danny danny lloyd the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that somethings wrong he has been told by the cook dick o hallorann scatman crothers that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy the titular shining which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future among other things because of this gift the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny even though he is quite capable of resisting them that is not jacks case however as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wifes affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick though having never worked on this kind of film before knew exactly what was effective and what wasnt hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths king criticized the director for changing most of the story omitting most of the jack danny subplot merely hinted at in the film that led to the books emotionally strong climax and while his disappointment is valid the omission was actually necessary the novel dealt with redemption albeit in an unconventional way and redemption is a theme kubrick one of the most famous analysts of human decay never had a soft spot for what he is interested in is the mental and subsequently physical unbalance that threatens the characters and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot dannys encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example another criticism king raised was about the actors especially nicholson in the writers opinion his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane thus undermining the rest of the story now it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning but it is equally true that martin sheen kings ideal choice for the role probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholsons from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal heres johnny scene it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part and even though the tv version of the shining from      isnt bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoos nest star as for duvall and lloyd both add terrific support the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens the omens damien and haley joel osment as cinemas great horror child icons one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart blonde and beautiful and not having much else to do but scream and run but two things ought to be considered a back in      the scream queen clich wasnt one yet b rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera making the book movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendys eyes irvine welsh the author of trainspotting once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work and he should know given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen yet that doesnt mean the movie is necessarily bad the shining proves said point to perfection very little from the novel approximately    is included in the film but in kubrick and nichlolsons hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest most original horror pictures of all time which really is saying something given the genres current poor form',\n",
       " 'nothin there aint nothing in room     but you aint got no business going in there anyway so stay out you understand stay out  never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves this is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for   months over the winter then the father jack becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect the tense tracking shots agonising music mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever made throughout the film there is constant references to danger death and horror red is used in every scene is the red purposely put in by kubrick of course this is a definitive kubrick classic and this is the third of his films i have given       he is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films he loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films i will be talking about this film for months to come it has infinite depth in conclusion this is the cornerstone of horror and tension a masterpiece of terror      ',\n",
       " '   spoilers     before i begin this let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the authorized version of this movie remade by stephen king himself in      both advantages made me appreciate this version of the shining all the more also let me say that ive read mr kings book the shining on many occasions over the years and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work stanley kubricks retelling of this story is far more compelling  and scary kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay itself he acquired the title magus beyond question kubricks genius is like magic the movie world lost a great director when he died in      among his other outstanding credits are eyes wide shut      full metal jacket      barry lyndon      a clockwork orange           a space odyssey      spartacus      and many more the torrences jack wendy his wife and danny their son are living in the overlook hotel for the winter jack has been hired as the caretaker it is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow until spring when the overlook reopens its doors it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the colorado mountains for a snow filled summer getaway the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging it lent to the atmosphere by having a dark yet at the same time welcoming atmosphere itself the furnishings and furniture was all period late   s   early   s and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world the introduction of wendy and dannys characters was a stroke of genius you get the whole story of their past dannys imaginary friend tony and the story of jacks alcoholism all rolled into this nice neat introductory scene there was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie obviously kubrick saw that from the beginning closing day again the scenic drive up the mountains to the hotel this time with family in tow the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking even as the staff is moving things out you get a chance to see the majestic fire places the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings dormants and crown moldings in the architecture they did a good job pink and gold are my favorite colors wendy torrence even the staff wing is well designed and beautifully built the maze was a magnificent touch reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the minotaur of crete was guardian when jack nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center seeing wendy and danny entering its a magickal moment one that tells you right away there are heavy energies in that house theres something seriously wrong already starting i wouldnt want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out the hotel manager scatman cruthers as dick halloran was genuine and open in his performance his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful you could actually believe you were there in the hotel taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and doc his explanation of the shining to danny was very well delivered as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel it was believable and sincere the cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself with the mountains looming behind the cold air swirling about mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie it also marks the half way to hell point so to speak the turning point in the movie shelley duvalls portrayal of wendy torrence was masterful so what if she also played olive oyl it just shows her marvelous diversity honestly before i saw the movie on the big screen in      i said what olive oyl  lol  popeye was also released in      but i took that back as soon as the movie started shes brilliant in this fiends opinion this is her best performance to date although i did love her in steve martins roxanne      once kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you the viewer need to be in possession the torrences past dannys broken arm tony the history of the hotel itself the fact that danny is not mental but rather clairvoyant instead and the general layout of the hotel all of which you get in the opening   sequences the movie never stops scaring you the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker delbert grady the girls having appeared several times to danny first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel were icons with which danny could identify and of which he was afraid at the same time they were haunting and haunted themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed in a rather graphic and material way kubricks tony was written as an attendant spirit like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father he wasthe little boy who lives in my mouth he would manifest in the end of dannys finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny not like in the book i realize where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy trying to save his father kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony took  danny  over the idea of dannys older self projecting back to his younger self isntscary the woman in the shower scene done by lia beldan about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before or since as the younger woman and billie gibson who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting it was dramatic and frightening abhorrent and scary when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real jack quickly embarks on his trek from the jonesing alcoholic to a certifiable insane person the degradation of his characters mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick jacks instant friendship with lloyd the bartender as only alcoholics would be mental patients and drug addicts do portrays his pressing need of the atmosphere to which lloyd avails him namely alcohol hair of the dog that bit me jack torrence in jacks case its bourbon on the rocks at no charge to jack orders from the house lloyd the bartender nice play on words when wendy finds jacks screenplay is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over albeit in   or   different creative styleswhen he asks from the shadows how do you like it and wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her handis so poignant its the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation ishow messed up jack is its very scary dramatic and delivers a strong presence that coupled with dannys visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood imposed over the scene between jack and wendy and with the confrontational ending to this scene make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie the redrum scene wow what do i say what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young troubled son standing over them with a huge knife talking in that freaky little voice exclaiming redrum over and over even if it had no meaning it would still be as scary as the  th level of hell it was something everyone could and has remembered speaking of memorable scenes nicholsons final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history his ad libbed line heeeeeres johnny was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror it also goes down in horror movie history the ending kubricks ending was perfection i felt it ended beautifully no smarm no platitudinous whining no tearfully idiotic ending for this movie just epitomized perfection thats all ill say on the subject of the ending who cares what was taken out look what kubrick put in rent it watch it buy it its a classic in the horror genre and for good reason it rawks  me being me   take this movie and sitck it in your stephen king collection and take the      authorized version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section thats where it belongs  this movie rates a     from the fiend ',\n",
       " 'sometimes it takes a film making master like kubrick to bring that extra little something that unique untractable and elusive ingredient that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece one for the ages its not just that stephen kings story has enough meat and potatoes making it difficult for even the most workmanlike of directors to miss heck even king himself didnt fare so bad its how kubrick perceives kings universe how he transforms the page into screen time that renders the shining both a visual feast and a compacted masterclass in directing kubricks miss en scene is as usually terrific the movie progresses with a brisk sharp lively pace even though its neither fast nor heavily edited and it clocks at no less than     minutes the camera prowls through the lavish corridors of the overlook hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration linear tracking shots exposing the impeccably decorated interiors in all their grandeur theres a symmetry and geometrical approach in how kubrick perceives space that reminds me very much of how japanese directors worked in the sixties as if what is depicted is inconsequential to how all the different elements are balanced inside the frame certain images definitely stand out the first shot of jacks typewriter accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself later on proving to be nothing short of just that a red river flowing through the hotels elevators in slow motion jack hitting the door with the axe the camera moving along with him tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static as though its the camera piercing through the door and not the axe the ultra fast zoom in the kids face thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his pov and of course the bathroom scene much has been said of jack nicholsons obtrusive overacting his mad is not entirely successful because well hes jack nicholson the guy looks half mad anyway playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself shelley duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices kubrick ever had coming from a streak of fantastic performances for robert altman in the seventies   women thieves like us nashville she brings to her character the right amounts of fragility and emotional distress a terrific and very underrated actress',\n",
       " 'okay okay maybe not the greatest i mean the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up but the shining is way up there it is however by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie its better than the stand better than pet sematary if not quite as scary better than cujo better than the green mile better the dolores claiborne better than stand by me just barely though and yes its better than the shawshank redemption shut up its better i dont care what the imdb top     says  i read that a couple of decades ago stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie and from the other room his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration finally she didnt hear any noise for almost two hours and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something i tell this with all due respect of course she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand and the book was the shining and thank god too because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever stephen king can be thanked for the complexity of the story about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing jack nicholson can be thanked for his dead on performance as jack torrance how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack as well as his flawless delivery of several now famous lines  heeeeeeres johnny shelley duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jacks desires to kill her stanley kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls one of the most significant aspects of this movie necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect is the isolation and its presents flawlessly the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel this time the scene is intermixed with shots of jack wendy and danny talking in the car in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of tv as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of danny who says that its okay because hes already seen it on tv  see its okay he saw it on the television the hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place and its bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge echoing rooms and the long hallways these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie and kubricks traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three dimensional feel early in the film there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his big wheel is that what those are called and his relative speed as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner and being a stephen king story you expect something to jump out at you i think that the best scene in the halls as well as one of the scariest in the film is when danny is playing on the floor and a ball rolls slowly up to him he looks up and sees the long empty hallway and because the ball is something of a childs toy you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him anyway you get the point the shining is a damn scary movie besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesnt suck the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed had jack always been there like mr grady told him in the mens room was he really at that ball in      or is that just someone who looks exactly like him if he has always been the caretaker as mr grady also said does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters and not mr grady after all its one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied thats just mediocre filmmaking for example the amityville horror which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter did this but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think as mostly all of kubricks movies are one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for and we should thank him for is for not throwing this book against the wall that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy',\n",
       " 'i was never a big fan of horror movies they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon it was well acted and had a great story but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubricks the shining quite possibly the scariest movie ever the movie follows a writer jack nicholson and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writers block after months of solitude and silence however jack becomes a grumpy and later violent is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad one of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes the hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty it is also eerily calm when jacks son is riding his bike through the barren hallways jack nicholsons performance is also one of his very best scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk in refrigerator the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the snot out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project it may be a oldie but is definitely a goodie     ',\n",
       " 'chilling majestic piece of cinematic fright this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot an ice cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization this movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red poker through a human eye as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems one of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind the setting is perfect in a desolate winter hideaway the quietness of the moment is a character in itself as the fermenting aggressor in jack torrances mind wallows in this idle time and breeds the devils new playground i always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds with only the circumstances of the moment and the reasons given therein needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims this film is a perfect example of this very thought and it is within this films subtle touches of the canvas the clackity clacks of the young boys big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel the labyrinthian garden representing the minds fine line between sane and insane kubricks purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies continuity errors and set mis arrangements that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown i have never read the book upon which the film is based but without that as a comparison point i am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that i have ever seen i thought that the runtime of the film couldve been cut by a little bit but then again i am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film so maybe i should keep my two cent criticisms over a superb film to myself all in all this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold eyed view of the mans mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity rating     ',\n",
